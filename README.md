# no.of-nodes-in-BST

This is a Python program to find the number of nodes in a binary tree.

Problem Description
The program creates a binary tree and counts the number of nodes in the tree.

Problem Solution
1. Create a class BinaryTree with instance variables key, left and right.
2. Define methods set_root, insert_left, insert_right, inorder and search.
3. The method set_root takes a key as argument and sets the variable key equal to it.
4. The methods insert_left and insert_right insert a node as the left and right child respectively.
5. The method inorder displays the inorder traversal.
6. The method search returns a node with a specified key.
7. Define the function count_nodes which takes a binary tree as argument.
8. The recursive function count_nodes returns the number of nodes in the binary tree.

Program Explanation
1. A variable is created to store the binary tree.
2. The user is presented with a menu to perform operations on the tree.
3. The corresponding methods are called to perform each operation.
4. The function count_nodes is called to count the number of nodes in the binary tree.
